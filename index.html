Over the years the institution has grown by leaps and bounds and opened its doors to not only admitting Kenyan students but also international students. At St. Joyuna, it’s our intention that our pupils receive all the things one can expect from a primary education: the chance to explore and discover new things about the world and themselves, the possibility to realize their potential, attain their goals and develop skills knowledge and attitude necessary for lifelong learning</p>
            <p>The schools started as a one building institution – currently the Pre-school Block. In 2022, we constructed our Upper Primary block.</p>
